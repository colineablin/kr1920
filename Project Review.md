# A football engigma
## Introduction 
We have decided to work on a program on Prolog able to resolve an enigma 

Here is the Enigma : 

*The football season was coming to an end and the regional playoffs were this weekend. Millersville’s high school team, the Bulls, had made it to the playoffs and hopes were high as the whole town counted down to the weekend and game time. Millersville High School hadn’t had a winning football team in years, and this year’s team had been undefeated during the regular season. The star player on each of the four contending teams played a different position. Determine the name of the four contending teams and the full name and position played of each star player.

The star player for the Bulls was a quarterback but his first name wasn’t Elliot.
The Chargers’ star player was Alex, who wasn’t a kicker. The receiver didn’t play on the Lions team.
Elliot’s last name wasn’t Fenn. Charlie’s last name was Koning.
Brandon wasn’t a receiver.
The running back had a last name of Zorn but he didn’t play for the Rams.
The player whose last name was Mansfield played for the Lions. The quarterback wasn’t Charlie.*
